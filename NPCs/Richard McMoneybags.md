Third of the McMoneybags name, arrested for rich people crimes. Very annoyed with Fun-Gus, but completely deflated once he learned who Gus's family is.

Absolutely insufferable. Will be out in around a week thanks to bribing the guards. 

Stashed his money in the third dumpster to the right behind the ironworks.
