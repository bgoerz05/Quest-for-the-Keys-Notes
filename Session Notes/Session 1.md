We are all informed when receiving our food that someone will be coming to get us out later today.

I get escorted out of solitary with a bag over my head. 
Ratman is brought in next, but during his release he manages to break free of the guards and find a kitchen full of cheese.
Jesus comes next.
Fun-Gus takes a while to walk down, being so far above the peasants.

[[Winona Bitchwoman]] enters and introduces herself, saying that she needs help with some shady business, and that we will receive clemency in return. 

After regaining our equipment, we are handed a letter from [[Dr. Catty Daniel]], inviting us to the *Sage's Quill* after sundown wearing a purple-hooded robe.

First, we pay a visit to the ironworks to redistribute some wealth, but Ratman goes to fight the boss of the factory and proceeds to get shot at. Me and Jesus manage to take care of that by knocking out Ratman, and removing the rat from the facility.
