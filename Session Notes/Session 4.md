We open in the [[Sage's Quill]]. [[Ratman]] eats some more Chernobyl cheese, which slows him down heavily and turns his skin to stone. He attempts to act as a statue, but gets called down by a passing cop. [[Jesus]] hears the noise when he jumps down from the balcony. It becomes canon that the 1st amendment only applies to people in the third tax bracket and above.

[[Serin]] is oblivious to the commotion outside, instead remaining locked in a deeper trance than usual, where he receives a vision. He begins reliving his years in the prison, flashing through those many years. As he leaves the cell for parole, he finds himself in a void darker than black. Serin stops, turning around come a set of deep, fiery eyes. Upon waking up, he notices that the shadows in his room seem to have vanished.

[[Fun-Gus]] awakes and calls [[The Doorman]] about the status of the fake egg, and is informed that it is ready for pickup. He stops by the bank to pick up the money for the egg. Before they leave, [[Dr. Catty Daniel]] stops and asks if the group is still up for the task.

Later in the day, we meet in the *Quill*. To recap the plan. The bottle will be uncorked, and I will pick the lock allowing Ratman to steal the egg. Gus will tackle the rat, swapping the egg with the fake one so the fake one can be returned.

After some more cheese-based shenanigans, Ratman acquires a unicorn horn, but is covered in blood and burns. The Ratman gets a makeover thanks to [[Dingle McFingerbottom]].

We head to the museum. [[Captain John Windall]] is running security, and in the conversation between him and [[Serin]], he lets slip that the egg is known to be one, and that it appears to be beginning to hatch. We regroup
