We begin heading to the *Sage's Quill*, and make a couple stops along the way. The first is for Jesus to pick up a pair of healer's kits, and the second is for Ratman to get a gun.

At Todd's, the gun store, Ratman tries to negotiate down the price of a gun. I recall that the place has a history of selling people weapons more lethal than they anticipated.

As we continue north, the affluence of the surroundings increases, until we see a sign for the Sage's Quill, a very upper-class establishment. Thankfully our party had a reservation from [[Dr. Catty Daniel]].

The lighting here is much softer than the neon of the city, the atmosphere is much quieter here. I manage to get ahead of Ratman launching towards the nearest charcuterie board.

We meet with our employer, who found a stone that she believes to be an egg. The egg has been brought to the Varkan Bluff Museum, and we need to make sure that the egg is gone before it hatches.

The museum's grand opening is coming up, where it will be displayed. 

I notice that while she seems to be largely telling us the truth, she is omitting some things. I notice that she mentioned the egg's "plane" of origin before correcting to "place."

We get a map of the museum and a bag of holding.

I go to the nearest guard station to investigate if there is an Eversmoking Bottle there that has been confiscated. There, in fact, was. I give the fake name of Steven Rattmann to the halfling running the civil claims.

Jesus and the Ratman go to scout out the museum. Jesus casts some reasonable spells to locate the egg, is unable to determine where any specific traps in the building are, and detects what is magical. Ratman tries to convince the guards, and later the event organizer, to see the stone. He ends up about to be escorted out before sneaking into the vents.

Gus goes home to his apartment, and has a conversation with the doorman. [[Jules]] is introduced, fully unexpecting to have Gus return, with the apartment in complete disarray.
