We begin with the [[Ratman]] wandering through the vents. He gets a scent of cheese, and finds himself in the midst of a large kitchen. He attempts to use mage hand to fetch himself a large handful of the edible gold. A chef takes notice, however, and manages to rescue most of it. Unfortunately, a slice of Chernobyl Cheese was lost to the rodent's ravenous maw.

[[Jesus]] has a conversation with a pair of kitchen workers that got fired for not noticing the giant rat hand, and tags along with them to get a bacon, egg, and cheese (and hopefully find the Ratman). Unfortunately, this conversation canonizes France to the world.

I return to the *[[Sage's Quill]]* to wait for the others, commit the map to memory, and converse a bit more with [[Dr. Catty Daniel]]. She tells me that the statues in the foyer are enchanted to become animated when the alarms are triggered. She also mentioned that the stone itself is upon some sort of pressure plate.

[[Fun-Gus]] chats more with [[Jules]], learning about what happened with the family since. [[Damian]], the second eldest, in in rehab. [[Stanley De'Opalid The Fourteenth]] has been remarried recently, to an elf rather than a human this time. He tries to pry into why Gus is headed to the gala, but they just say that [[Stanley De'Opalid The Thirteenth]] wants to show that Gus is alive.

Jesus and the pair of unnamed NPCs arrive at the *Toaster Bin* and have a long (and largely one-sided) conversation with the counter worker. 

Returning to Ratman in the museum, he eats the cheese. Firstly, his skin turns a glowing blue. With his second bite, four people in the kitchen get flung backward and knocked off their feet. With his final bite, he gets a halo that makes him able to tell easily if people are lying to him. Taking advantage of the chaos, he descends down to cause more devastation upon the cheese table. Through a series of hijinks, he ends up in a cooking competition to see who gets the chef's job.

Jules reveals that he pawned off Gus's sword, and that he believed that Gus would die in prison quite quickly. Fun-Gus tells him to check into rehab, and then calls his mother, asking her to allow him to take care of Damian, and they get the money needed to rebuy the sword. In order to get a discount, Gus gives the pawn shop owner the name of his captain that sells mushrooms.

Jesus returns to the museum with the cheese sandwiches, and carries them around trying to draw out the Rat. This works, distracting him enough that he abandons the competition, snatches as much cheese as possible, and bolts. They hastily exit the museum and return to the *Sage's Quill*.

By the time they return, the Rat's powers of insight fade. We plan out our heist.
